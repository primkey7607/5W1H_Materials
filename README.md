# Comprehensive and Comprehensible Data Catalogs: The What, Who, Where, When, Why, and How of Metadata Management
In this repository, we provide all materials used to produce the results presented in the paper with the above name, which can be found at the following link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07532.

Specifically, we provide all materials that can be used to understand and generate our results in Section V. We explain what we include below.

## [Survey Language](https://github.com/primkey7607/5W1H_Materials/tree/main/SurveyLanguage)
We include a pdf with the survey text in the SurveyLanguage/ directory of this repository, where we explain the survey that was shown to participants in Section V-A of our paper. To avoid spurious survey responses and mitigate threats to validity, we made specific choices with regards to the language and flow of the survey, which we explain in this directory.
