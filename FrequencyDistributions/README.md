# Section IV-C: Frequency Distributions
In this directory, we include the frequency distribution CSV files we use to generate our consistency and ease-of-understanding results explained in Tables III-VI in Section IV-C.

## Consistency
We include our frequency distributions describing counts per MM partition for each data question in folder MMQuestionCounts/.
We also include the code to generate the values we present in Tables III, IV, and V. Note that we manually altered the code output for presentation purposes, so the code output does not generate the tables exactly as they appear in the paper.
However, the values are the same.

We explain further run instructions in the MMQuestionCounts directory.

## Ease-of-Understanding
We include our frequency distributions describing difficulty ratings for each data question in folder MMQuestionRatings/.
We also include the code to generate the values we present in Table VI. Note that we manually altered the code output for presentation purposes, so the code output does not generate the table exactly as it appears in the paper.
However, the values are the same. 

We explain further run instructions in the MMQuestionRatings directory.
